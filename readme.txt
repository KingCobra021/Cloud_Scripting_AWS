findAMI is not my work it is provided by the professor "Richard Pazzi". I included it in case the script won't break due to dependencies

launchEC2 is a scrip that accepts the count key name and security group name from the user and uses the findAMI to launch AWS EC2 instances equal to the count amount provided by the user

stopAll is a script that stops all instances that have the tad that matches the one user entered
